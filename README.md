 This application demonstrates how to implement voice calling for mobile devices, browsers (WebRTC), and any SIP client using the [Catapult API](http://ap.bandwidth.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=dtolb&utm_content=_).
    This reference application makes creating, registering, and implementing voice calling for endpoints (mobile, web, or any SIP client) easy.
    This application implements the steps documented [here](http://ap.bandwidth.com/docs/how-to-guides/use-endpoints-make-receive-calls-sip-clients/).

You can open up the web page at the root of the deployed project for more instructions and for example of voice calling in your web browser using WebRTC.
